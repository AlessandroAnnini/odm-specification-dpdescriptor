# Roles and Responsibilities

## Technical Steering Committee
The Technical Steering Committee is the sole entity authorized to make decisions regarding changes to the specification or governance rules outlined in this document.

### Responsibilities
The TSC is responsable of:

* Evaluating and approving or rejecting proposed changes to the specification
* Evaluating and approving or rejecting proposed changes to the governance
* Evaluating and approving or rejecting proposals for TSC membership additions or removals
* Evaluating and approving or rejecting proposals for assignments or removals of the Maintainer role
* Appointing the TSC Chair

### Adding a member
Anyone can propose their candidacy to become a member of the TSC by writing to [odm.info@quantyca.it](mailto:odm.info@quantyca.it). The TSC is responsible for evaluating all applications and accepting or rejecting them. Although applications are individual, it is not possible to have more than two members of TSC belonging to the same company. 

The TSC can have a maximum of 15 members, including the Chairman. Applications can still be submitted. However, once the maximum number of 15 members has been reached, to add a new member it is necessary to remove an existing one or modify the governance rules described here. 

The TSC should normally have no less than 5 members. If the number of members falls below this threshold, it is the responsibility of the TSC itself to mobilize to identify new members.

### Removing a member
TSC member removal is possible under the following circumstances:

* Direct request from the member
* absence from more than three consecutive TSC meetings
* violation of the Code of Conduct

The request to remove a member can be initiated by the member or by another TSC member. The TSC is responsible for accepting or rejecting the removal proposals.
  
### Committee Meetings
At least once a year to elect the chairman. Preferably not less than once a quarter. Every member can propose a new meeting. Once the data is scheduled and the agenda defined the meeting must be announced in the discussion session and pinned. Modifications to the agenda can be proposed in the associated discussion thread. All community members can participate in the TSC meeting. Meetings should be recorded.
