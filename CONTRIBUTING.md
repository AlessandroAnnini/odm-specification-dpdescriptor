# Data Product Descriptor Specification Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

## Spreading the Word
Spreading the word about the specification is a great way to help the community grow and ensure that more people are aware of its benefits. 
Here are some ways you can help:

* Share your experience using the specification on social media, forums, or relevant communities
* Mention the specification in talks, articles, or blog posts you create and let us know on Slack
* Use the specification [logo](https://dpds.opendatamesh.org/images/logos/opendatamesh.png) or [website link](https://dpds.opendatamesh.org/) on your website or documentation

## Asking questions
We wholeheartedly welcome your questions!  They're not just accepted, they're vital for fostering knowledge exchange within our community. 
It's through these inquiries that the specification evolves, becoming progressively clearer and more user-friendly. Follow these steps to
ask questions:

* Search for existing discussions and issues before creating a new question
* Post your question as a new discussion thread
* Clearly articulate your question and provide context if needed
* Use descriptive titles easier searchability

## Sharing your knowledge
The spirit of sharing is at the heart of our community. By actively participating and sharing your knowledge and experience, 
you play a vital role in supporting and empowering other community members. 
Here are some ways to get involved:

* Answer questions in the discussion section
* Provide feedback to open issue

## Joining the conversation on Slack
Slack is our go-to platform for informal communication and collaboration within the community. 
Joining ongoing conversations on Slack channels is a fantastic way to connect with other community members, stay in the loop on 
community happenings, and gain insights into the latest developments.

* Introduce yourself in `#introduce-yourself` channel
* Check the last updates in `#announcements` channel
* Join ongoing discussions in `#dpds` channel

## Adopting the Specification
The success of the specification is tied to its adoption. One of the most effective ways to contribute to its success 
is therefore to use it and share your experiences. These are some examples of how you can use the specification:

* Adopt the specification in your data management projects
* Make your data management tool compliant with the specification
* Implement an adapter to use a DPDS document together with third-party tool (ex. importers/exporters)
* Implement a utility tool to support the  development of a DPDS document (es. linter, validator, diff, composer, etc ...)
  
## Reporting Errors
Effectively reporting errors like typos, imprecision, ambiguity, and contradictions is a critical contribution to the success of the specification. 
Follow these steps to report an error:

* Check open issues and pull requests to ensure the error hasn't already been reported
* If you are unsure if what you have found is an actual error or not ask in the [discussion section](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/odm-specification-dpdescriptor/discussions) here on GitHub or in the `#dpds` channel on [Slack](#Joining-the conversation-on-Slack)
* Report the error
    * Open a new issue
    * Set a clear title that describes the error and facilitates search (e.g., "Typo in Expectation Object Description").
    * Explain what you found, including a reference to the part of the specification that contains the potential error
    * Suggest a change (if possible) to fix the error:
    * Specify if the proposed change is only editorial or has impacts on the specification
    * If the change to fix the error is just editorial you can also submit directly a pull request without opening an issue before
