## Blindata.io
<a href="https://blindata.io/" target="_blank">Blindata :octicons-link-external-24:</a> is a 
SAAS platform that leverages Data Governance and Compliance to empower Data Management projects

Blindata.io uses the specification to collect and store in its *knowledge graph* all metadata related to deployed data products. Through its UI and API it is then possible to analyze the mesh topology (i.e. static and dynamic data lineage), discover and evaluate data products (i.e. search and collaboration),  monitor data quality SLA and SLO, ecc... 

In a [DataMeshOps platform](../concepts/meshops-platform.md), blindata.io offers all the key services to implement the [data mesh experience plane](../concepts/meshops-platform.md#data-mesh-experience-plane).  

Blindata.io is integrated with [Open Data Mesh Platform](#open-data-mesh-platform) providing a control plane to its services. Through its UI the users can govern data product's lifecycle from a visual and unified environment.
