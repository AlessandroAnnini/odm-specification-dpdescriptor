![Open Data Mesh Initiative Logo](./docs/images/logos/opendatamesh.png)

The **Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS)** is a community-driven open specification that declaratively defines a data product in all its components using a JSON or YAML descriptor document. It is released under [Apache 2.0 licence](./LICENSE). Contributions from the data community are welcomed!

## Status
There is not yet a general available version of the specification. Version 1.0.0 is in DRAFT state. We plan to collect community feadbacks and contributions over the following months in order to finalize and release it in GA state. There is not yet a planned date for the release of version 1.0.0 in GA but ideally we would like to release it by the end of Q1 of 2023.

This is the **current working draft** of the specification:

- [Data Product Descriptor Specification v1.0.0-DRAFT](./versions/1.0.0-DRAFT.md)
