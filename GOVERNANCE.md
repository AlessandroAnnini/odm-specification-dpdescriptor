# Data Product Descriptor Governance Guide

*Work in progress*

The Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS) is a project of the Open Data Mesh Initiative (ODMI). For governance of the ODMI, review the [ODMI's charter].

# Processes and procedures of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The TSC is a self-organizing sub-group of the OAI. Herein are its principles and guidelines.

## 1. The establishment of roles and the responsibilities for each role

Roles:

* TODO
  
## 2. Adding members to the TSC

A call-for-nominations period may be agreed upon by the TSC voting members and announced in a timely manner on a weekly TDC call (and documented on the agenda issue), 
assuming the TSC membership is not already at its maximum. A candidate may be nominated through a motion by a voting TSC member in a closed TSC meeting. 
A nominee must not receive opposition votes of more than 25% of the TSC voting membership via a confidential vote held electronically within a week following the 
nomination meeting. Approved nominees become provisional members and are expected to comport themselves as full members of the TSC during the provisional period 
of 6 months. The provisional period is concluded by a second, confidential vote similar to the nomination period's vote, after which newly confirmed members gain their voting rights. 
At most there are four voting periods per year (no more than one every three months), with a minimum of one per year.

## 3. Removal of membership from the TSC

Occasionally it may be necessary to remove a TSC member, such as behavior that violates the code of conduct or prolonged absenteeism. 
A 66% vote (confidential, electronic) of the other TSC members is required to remove a member. Otherwise, TSC members are removed when they 
renounce their position by informing the TSC of their effective resignation date via email.

## 4. Criteria for decisions

The group will strive to achieve all decisions via unopposed consensus. When not possible, unresolved conflicts will be raised to the OAI's Initiative Board (IB).

The TSC will maintain a publicly available document specifying the process in the contributor guidelines for how proposed changes are merged into the specification.

The TSC will document and publicize the schedule of merge parties and release parties for the benefit of the developer community.
