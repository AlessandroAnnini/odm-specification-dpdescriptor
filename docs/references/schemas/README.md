# JSON Schema Versions


Here you can find JSON Schemas for validating all available [specification versions](./README.md).

For each version of the specification together with the pointer to the actual JSON Schema definition file, it is also provided a pointer to its `html` documentation generated with <a href="https://coveooss.github.io/json-schema-for-humans" target="_blank">JSON Schema for Human :octicons-link-external-24:</a>.

- [JSON Schema for specification version **1.0.0-DRAFT**](./1.0.0-DRAFT.md)

???+ warning
    The JSON Schema is not the source of truth for the Specification. In cases of conflicts between the Specification itself and the JSON Schema, the Specification wins. Also, some Specification constraints cannot be represented with the JSON Schema so it's highly recommended to employ other methods to ensure compliance.
