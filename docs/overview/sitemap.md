This site contains all the available documentation related to the Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS). The site is orgaized as follow:

- [Overview](./overview/README.md): This page describes what the specification is about, its goals and scope. Start from here to understand if this specification feets with your needs or not before to deep dive in other parts of the documentation.
- [Concepts](./concepts/README.md): This page describe the key concepts used in the specification and through out all the documentation. Most of them are related to *data mesh paradigm*. Ths page anyway is not a data mesh guide. It just positionates some data mesh concepts in the scope of this specification to avoid possible source of ambiguity. 
- [Quikstart](./quickstart/README.md): This pages describe the key parts of the specification in an informal and incremental way to simplify the learning process.
- [HowTo(s)](./howto/README.md): This pages contain guides that describe how to perform specific activites related to the DPDS lifecycle management.
- [Contributions](./contributions/README.md): This page expalins the possible ways to contribute to the specification evolution.

    - [Specifications](./references/specifications/README.md): This page points to html version of the DPDS.
    - [Json Schema](./references/schemas/README.md): This page contains the documenation of the JSON Schema defied to validate data product descriptor definition compliant with the DPDS.
    - [Examples](./references/examples.md): This page contains some examples of valid data product descriptor definition together with their description.
    - [External Tools](./references/tools.md): This page contains a list of tools that use the standard devided by category.
    - [Related Standards](./references/standards.md): This page contains tahe list of other stnadard that are related with the DPDS devided by category.
    - [Data Mesh Resources](./references/resources.md): This page contains a list of resources useful to start learning about data mesh paradigm.

???+ note
    All the documentation above assume a previous knowledge about data mesh paradigm. If you are new to the topic and you want to know more this documentation is not the right place. Please check the [Data Mesh Resources](./datamesh/README.md) page to find out better resources to start your data mesh study.
