The **Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS)** is a community-driven open specification that declaratively defines a data product in all its components using a JSON or YAML descriptor document. It is released under [Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE). Contributions from the data community are welcomed!

## Status
There is not yet a generally available version of the specification. Version 1.0.0 is in a DRAFT state. We plan to collect community feedback and contributions over the following months to finalize and release it in the GA state. There is not yet a planned date for the release of version 1.0.0 in GA but ideally, we would like to release it by the end of Q1 of 2023.

This is the **current working draft** of the specification:

- [Data Product Descriptor Specification v1.0.0-DRAFT](./versions/1.0.0-DRAFT.md)
