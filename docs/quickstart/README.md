# Quickstart

The [Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS)](../references/specifications/README.md)  is the ultimate source of knowledge regarding this data product description format. However, its length is daunting to newcomers and makes it hard for experienced users to find specific bits of information. This page provides a soft landing for readers not yet familiar with DPDS and is organized by topic, simplifying browsing.

The following pages introduce the syntax and structure of a data product descriptor document, its main building blocks and a minimal data product descriptor document. Afterwards, the different blocks are detailed, starting from the most common and progressing towards advanced ones.

- [Descriptor Document Overview](./overview.md): JSON, YAML
- [Minimal Descriptor Document](./overview.md): `dataProductDescriptor` and `info`
- [Interface Components](./interface.md): `interfaceComponents`, `promises`, `expectations` and `contracts`
- [Application Components](./application.md): `applicationComponents`, `buildService` and `deploymentService`
- [Infrastructural Components](./infrastructure.md): `infrastructuralComponents` and  `provisioningService`
- [Reusing Descriptions](./components.md): `components` and `$ref`.
- [External Resources](./resources): *coming soon...*
- [Standard Definitions](./definitions): *coming soon...*
- [Extending the specification](./extensions): *coming soon...*
- [Putting all together](./extensions): *coming soon...*
