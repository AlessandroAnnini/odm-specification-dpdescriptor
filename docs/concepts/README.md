# General Concepts

Before to deep dive in the [Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS)](../references/specifications/1.0.0.md) it's important to set the stage introducing some general concepts. Most of them are related to *data mesh paradigm*. This page anyway IS NOT a data mesh guide. It just positionates some data mesh concepts in the scope of this specification to avoid possible source of ambiguity. Check the [Data Mesh Resources](../references/resources.md) page to find out better resources to start learn more about data mesh.
