# Quickstart

The [Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS)](../resources/specifications/README.md)  is the ultimate source of knowledge regarding this data product description format. However, its length is daunting to newcomers and makes it hard for experienced users to find specific bits of information. This page provides a soft landing for readers not yet familiar with DPDS and is organized by topic, simplifying browsing.

The first page of the quickstart describe the architecture and purpose of the *Trip Execution Data Product* used in the other pages to explain the specification.
The following pages introduce the syntax and structure of a data product descriptor document, its main building blocks and a minimal data product descriptor document. Afterwards, the different blocks are detailed, starting from the most common and progressing towards advanced ones. 

- [Trip Execution Data Product Overview](./example.md): Architecture and purpose of the example data product
- [Data Product Descriptor Document Overview](./overview.md): JSON, YAML
- [Minimal Descriptor Document](./overview.md): `dataProductDescriptor` and `info`
- [Interface Components](./interface.md): `interfaceComponents`, `promises`, `expectations` and `contracts`
- [Application Components](./application.md): `applicationComponents`, `buildService` and `deploymentService`
- [Infrastructural Components](./infrastructure.md): `infrastructuralComponents` and  `provisioningService`
- [Reusing descriptions](./components.md): `components` and `$ref`.
- [External Resources](./resources.md): fields of type [External Resource Object](../resources/specifications/last.md#applicationComponent)
- [Providing documentation](./definitions.md): `summary`, `description` and `externalDocs`
- [Extending the specification](./extensions.md): custom fields, extension points and esternal standards
- [Putting all together](./summary.md): *coming soon...*
